# ðŸ§  Database Internals in Go

This repository is a collection of core data structures and algorithms that form the foundation of modern database systems â€” all implemented in Go. It's designed to be a learning-oriented, modular project that balances theoretical depth with practical code.

Each component is built independently, with an emphasis on clarity, composability, and testability. The goal is to help engineers understand *how* and *why* things work the way they do in real-world systems â€” by building them from scratch.

The codebase is structured to allow incremental exploration, whether you're experimenting with a single concept or composing multiple pieces into something larger. Standalone demos, unit tests, and well-documented modules make the project easy to navigate.

Ideal for curious engineers, system designers, and anyone interested in peeling back the layers of abstraction that power data infrastructure.
